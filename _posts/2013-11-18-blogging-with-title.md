# Dropout Boxes, TL;DR Header

This is where the TL;DR header summary should go

This is a body of text. I'm not sure how long it will be but it might be long. Or maybe not.

 + What is the point of a question?
 -----------------
To answer things I suppose...


<details><summary>stuff with *mark* **down**</summary><p>

## _formatted_ **heading** with [a](link)

---
{{standard 3-backtick code block omitted from here due to escaping issues}}

Collapsible until here.
</p></details>
